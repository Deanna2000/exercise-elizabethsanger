#Exercise Book 2, chapter 8

##Objectives:

You have volunteered your time to a local political candidate, Elizabeth Sanger, who wants to become a US representative in Congress for your district. Unfortunately, the team discovered that you're a software developer, so they have begged you to build an application that lets them track volunteers, and store information about Elizabeth and her campaign.

Your job is to define the different objects and resources, their structure, and the corresponding properties for each, to represent the following information about Elizabeth's campaign.

1. Her congressional district (you can use yours here)
2. Her platform statements for the following issues.
    Taxes
    Jobs
    Infrastructure
    Health care
    Crime and enforcement
3. URL for donation form
4. Calendar of events
5. Volunteer information
    Name
    Address
    Email
    Phone number
    Availability
    What activities each one is willing to do (e.g. answering phone calls, taking polls, etc.)
6. Biography
7. Image gallery
    Head shot
    Picture of family
    Picture of constituents
8. Mission statement
9. URL for registering to vote

##Challenge
After you have defined all the objects for representing the data, write a corresponding function for each one whose purpose is to change the state of the object. Then invoke each function, and pass a reference to the correct object to it and modify a property.



Lessons Learned:
*   the property "writable" (true or false) means whether you are able to change the object valu
* default values for properties is "false"
